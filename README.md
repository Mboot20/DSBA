Analyzed and grouped three hundred stocks data based on their attributes. Developed Kmeans Clustering model and selected the optimal number of clusters- K leveraging the elbow and the KElbow Visualizer methods that resulted in a value of k of 6 and validated it with the silhouette score and the silhouette visualizer. Developed Hierarchical Clustering model, generated a cophenetic correlation of 0.73 obtained with Euclidian distance and average linkage, and visualized dendrograms to spot the optimal number of clusters of six. Generated the cluster profiles and shared insights about each group with the company.
